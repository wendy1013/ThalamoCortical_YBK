# rsFC_thalamoCortical_voxel_corr

1. Resting state fMRI preprocessing 
2. Each thalamic voxel -- each whole brain voxel correlation ("functional connectivity")
3. Temporal concat ICA (group)
4. Regression (individual subject)

* Will be augmenting or augmented by DTI tractography

* Led by:
		Yoo Bin Kwak & Kevin Cho

* Preliminary round began May 11th, 2017
