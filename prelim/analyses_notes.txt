scp -r ${i}_bet 
    (contains raw rs & t1, bet-ed rs & t1)


1. DPABI preprocessing -- remove initial 4 ts, slice timing, realign
    - input: bet_ed rsfMRI

    - missed 12 subjects (subjects who did not go trhough 2nd round of bet) -> ran dpabi separately
    - CHR64_KYJ missing (have dti, but no rs_

    -> tr chages to 1 (from original 3.5)


2. fix header info for tr (1 -> 3.5)


3. registration -- epi_reg & fnirt
    * need common base name for T1 & T1_brain
    - rsfMRI input: tr_fixed_ra
    
    - ran parallel (17 cores)
        - error at last line (can't open EPI_image for "applywarp --ref=${MNI_brain} --in=${EPI_image} --out=${Reg_dir}/rs_to_mni --warp=${Reg_dir}/rs_to_mni_warp")
            - "rs_to_mni_warp.nii.gz" created
            
            - tried running the line for CHR04, seems to work fine


4. nuisance regression
    - 1st command line for error from "registration.sh"
        -> ran fine (no error)
    - ran  parallel (17 cores)


5. downsample & temporal filter
    - ran parallel (17 cores)


6. corr
    - only fisherZ, bp, fnirt outoput (took up to much space if running hp & flirt, as well)
        - deleted nonfisherZ, hp & flirt
        - deleted fisherZ_bp
    -> tr changes to 1
    -> images become "fuzzy"


7. melodic
    - ran with parallel (4cores)

    -try rernning not using parallel (-> re_*)
        -> bp 
        -> 4ds_bp_fnirt_10 (bc no convergence)
        -> 4ds_bp_fnirt_auto 
            -> terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::cad_alloc'
                what(): std::bad_alloc
        -> 3ds_bp_fnirt_auto 
            -> terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::cad_alloc'
                what(): std::bad_alloc

    => successful outputs:
        -3ds 10
        -3ds 20
        -4ds 20

ACCIDENTALLY DELETED CHR33

8. dual regression
    => output from eachIC is the right one
        - when spliting, name output files to include number of components

    - deleted dual_reg

#9. ave then find biggest
    -> tried, but not the right approach
    => randomize

9. randomize (no demo)
    - merge each ICs across subjects, run randomize
    - for viewing results, seems fslmaths -add is better (?) than  fslmerge



running 3ds_bp_fnirt auto -- begain 5:25pm 2017/06/12
    -> same problem


try running melodic auto as M2
    - scp data to M2
